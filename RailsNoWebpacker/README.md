# Slick Carousel With Rails Gem

Demonstrates how to integrate Slick carousel with [jquery-slick-rails gem](https://github.com/bodrovis/jquery-slick-rails). Also presents a potential solution to carousel not playing nicely with Turbolinks (check the `pages/index` view).

To run it locally:

* Clone the repo.
* Install the gems (`bundle install`).
* Boot the server (`rails s`).
* Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
